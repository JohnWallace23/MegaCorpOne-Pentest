# MegaCorpOne-Pentest
This is the report I made for MegaCorpOne (simulated penetration test).
This report contains screenshots of vulnerabilities and exploits that I was able to find using Kali inside an Azure virtual Machine. I used a combination of SQL Injections, Metasploit, and Nessus to get the results that I got. 
Check out my report to learn more! I give brief overview of what these exploits are and effective remediation techniques
