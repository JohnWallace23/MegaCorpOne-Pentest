# MegaCorpOne-Pentest
This is the report I made for MegaCorpOne. (simulated Jr. Penetration Tester)
This report contains screenshots of vulnerabilities and exploits that I was able to find using Kali inside an Azure virtual Machine. I used a combination of SQL Injections, Metasploit, and Nessus to get the results that I got.
